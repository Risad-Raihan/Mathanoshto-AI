cracking with eight important AI trends in 2025. Agentic AI Let's start with an obvious one. Number one. Agenetic AI. Every time we post the video about agents to this channel, viewership spikes. So there's clearly an appetite for understanding this tech. So what are AI agents? Well, the intelligence systems that can reason they can plan and they can take action. An agent can break down complex problems to create multi step plans and that can interact with tools and databases to achieve goals. [...] And I think most people are on board with the utility of a well-performing AI agent. Trouble is, today's models, well, they struggle with consistent logical reasoning. They can usually execute simple plans, but when it comes to handling complex scenarios with multiple variables, they have to lose track and they make decisions that don't quite add up. So we'll need better models in 2025. Speaking of which, trends number two is inference time compute. Inference Time Compute Now, during inference
